# Barak-app
Application that takes a data set in a specific structure and plots it in a graph.

I created this app for a friend of my father who started a company that measuers radiation.
The output of his measuring device is *.csv file the looks like this:[date,x,y,z,total,size].
He uses the date, total and size columns so I remove the x,y,z columns and plot it.

He can choose the amount of ticks in the x-axis and its angle of display.
