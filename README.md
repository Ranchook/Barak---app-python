# Barak-app
Application that takes a data set in a specific structure and plots it in a graph.

I created this app for a friend of my father who started a company that measuers radiation.
The output of his measuring device is *.csv file the looks like this: [date,x,y,z,total,size].
He uses the date, total and size columns so I remove the x,y,z columns and plot it.

The graph gets the same name as the data file, and is saved as a *.jpg file. 

The data must be placed in a specific folder and the output graphs are also in a specific folder.

He can choose the amount of ticks in the x-axis and its angle of display.

An example for a graph:
